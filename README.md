# Main
I did this repository during my work at LATMOS on mesospheric clouds in the Martian atmosphere.


## 1. Root
This directory contains the main python script 'ncplot.pt'

### 1.1 ncplot.py
Designed to plot NETCDF4 file from the LMD-MGCM. This python script is especially designed to CO<sub>2</sub> clouds simulation (co2clouds flag in the MGCM).

You can find more details about this script, and especially about figures you can done with it, at the wiki: https://github.com/ChristopheMathe/mars-co2cloud/wiki

### 1.2 Check_watercycle.py

### 1.3 extract_profile.py


## 2. Spicam_cloud
This directory contains the main python script 'stats.py', analysing SPICAM data to find cold pockets and their characteristics.

Cold pockets are defined when the temperature environment of the Mars atmosphere is below the condensation temperature of the carbon dioxide.

## 3. Miscallenaous
